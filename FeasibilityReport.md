# Project Feasibility

## Introduction
In a world where travel and exploration have become intrinsic parts of modern lifestyles, the need for efficient access to local events has grown significantly. This project aims to address this need by providing travellers with a centralized solution to discover effortlessly events in their destination cities. 


This Feasibility report outlines the potentiality of developing an innovative platform that aggregates events from various sources, including Eventbrite, Meetup, Ticket Source, and more by creating a platform that will connect to these website’s databases while offering a user-friendly interface. 


The Project is driven by the need to alleviate the common frustration of travellers that spend excessive time researching and scouring different websites for local events, but it can also be used by local people.
For all these reasons, it is believed that this project is highly useful and should be taken into consideration.

## Background
Based on the World Travel and Tourism Council report 2023, the global tourism arrivals will increase by 30% in 2023 but will remain below pre-pandemic levels.

After COVID-19, the travel industry has witnessed a transformative shift in travellers’ requirements and preferences, and in addition the emergence of new trends explored by WTTC report also highlights the rise of short travel, renew interest in secondary destinations, and puts emphasis on sustainability and wellness experiences. 
These trends underscore the critical need for a platform that aligns with travellers’ desires for personalized and meaningful experiences in their chosen destinations and reinforce the idea that this project will give a significant contribution to increase the positive trend explored and analysed by the WTTC report.

Platform like the one proposed would be a significant help for secondary destination which often do not have enough funds for advertising events in a wider audience, and eventually benefitting the travellers who will get to know more about small local events.

Furthermore, the project encompasses all social and cultural groups, embracing its user range without any age limitations in the absence of other direct competitors.


## Outline of Project
This project that will be called TEG, an acronym easy to remember that stands for “Traveller Events Guide”, and will serve as a bridge between travellers and a multitude of events, usually founded by visit different websites such as Eventbrite, Meetup, Ticket source and so on. In this way, they can easily find activities that align with their preferences. 

Users will have the option to tailor their event suggestions based on their interests, allowing them to easier discover art exhibitions, sports matches, music concerts, and more. The core innovation lies in the aggregation of events from different platforms, enabling the user to optimise the discovering of interesting events in as vast as diverse sea of opportunities. 

The project will begin with a focused selection of cities, expanding over time in the future the offering of cities, and introducing a geo-localized feature that suggests events in proximity.
Potential future features include the usage of Machine learning based optimization that will tailor the preferences of the events based on previous choices.

The development process will involve a fist phase with minimal list of features:  an API that will source the events from a local database and serves them to a front-end application (website); and periodic updates from external sources (like EventBrite) which guarantee that TEG’s database is up to date. 

The user interface will prioritize ease of use, addressing the needs of both younger and older demographics. This adaptability aims to make event discovery accessible to a wide range of travellers. 

In addition, the platform’s potential for expansion into collaborations with other travel-related applications (ex: Airbnb, Booking,…) contributes to its unique value proposition by offering a comprehensive travel-experience.


## Conclusion
The feasibility analysis indicates strong potential for the TEG project: it aligns with evolving travel trends, matching them towards tailored experiences, sustainability, and well-being. 

The collaboration with accommodation solutions enhances its value proposition. The absence of direct competitors and the projected growth in the global travel sector emphasize the project's practically and utility. 

Based on comprehensive analysis, TEG holds the attributes necessary for a successful position in the market, promising a valuable contribution to the evolving travel landscape.
